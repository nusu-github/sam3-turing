# Native runtime development log

## 2026-09-22 — mask/NMS foundation

User clarified that no Turing hardware will be available. Do not block on its
procurement. Continue independently and optimize after functional completion
until asked to stop. Hardware performance claims must remain Blackwell-only.

Implemented a shared C++/CUDA library, no Python link dependency:

- Mask packing/unpacking, independently padded rows, noncontiguous input support.
- Chunked bilinear resize and sigmoid with original dtype rounding.
- Generic IoU-matrix NMS, stable score ties, strict greater-than suppression,
  no detection count cap. Current CUDA baseline uses one cooperative block for
  greedy suppression and an ATen boolean matrix, leaving optimization scope.
- Development dispatcher registration and standalone C++ CPU/CUDA executables.
- Windows/Linux standalone CPU LibTorch CI (results pending first pushed run).

Validation: 4 local CTest cases and 46 CPU + 46 CUDA parity scenarios passed.
Coverage includes empty input, tail bits, noncontiguous layouts, float16/32/64,
FP16 sigmoid threshold rounding, invalid shapes, tied scores, threshold equality,
8,203 detections, and a nondefault CUDA stream. See `ops-validation.json`.
`cuobjdump` found sm_75 and sm_120 cubins (Torch CMake also added intermediate
architectures). C++ CUDA test passed with Python removed from PATH. Shared
library is linked to the development installation's LibTorch, not yet packaged
for standalone relocation. Turing hardware execution has not been tested.

Next work: finish connected components / EDT, capture model reference fixtures,
measure shared checkpoint tensors, implement the common weight store and native
model components. No complete SAM3 native inference, C ABI, Windows CUDA proof,
or model-level numerical comparison exists yet.
