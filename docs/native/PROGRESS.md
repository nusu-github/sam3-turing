# Native runtime development log

## 2026-09-22 — mask/NMS foundation

User clarified that no Turing hardware will be available. Do not block on its
procurement. Continue independently and optimize after functional completion
until asked to stop. Hardware performance claims must remain Blackwell-only.

Implemented a shared C++/CUDA library, no Python link dependency:

- Mask packing/unpacking, independently padded rows, noncontiguous input support.
- Chunked bilinear resize and sigmoid with original dtype rounding.
- Generic IoU-matrix NMS, stable score ties, strict greater-than suppression,
  no detection count cap. Current CUDA baseline uses one cooperative block for
  greedy suppression and an ATen boolean matrix, leaving optimization scope.
- Development dispatcher registration and standalone C++ CPU/CUDA executables.
- Initially added Windows/Linux CPU CI; subsequently removed per user instruction.

Validation: 4 local CTest cases and 46 CPU + 46 CUDA parity scenarios passed.
Coverage includes empty input, tail bits, noncontiguous layouts, float16/32/64,
FP16 sigmoid threshold rounding, invalid shapes, tied scores, threshold equality,
8,203 detections, and a nondefault CUDA stream. See `ops-validation.json`.
`cuobjdump` found sm_75 and sm_120 cubins (Torch CMake also added intermediate
architectures). C++ CUDA test passed with Python removed from PATH. Shared
library is linked to the development installation's LibTorch, not yet packaged
for standalone relocation. Turing hardware execution has not been tested.

Next work: finish connected components / EDT, capture model reference fixtures,
measure shared checkpoint tensors, implement the common weight store and native
model components. No complete SAM3 native inference, C ABI, Windows CUDA proof,
or model-level numerical comparison exists yet.

## Validation ownership update

User requested no GitHub Actions for now and will handle Turing/Windows testing.
The native workflow run was canceled, the workflow disabled and removed. Linux
CPU CI had completed successfully before cancellation; Windows results are not
a gate or a claimed validation. Future checks run locally; no Actions polling
or new CI runs should be introduced. Provide user-facing reproduction commands
for Windows/Turing without blocking development on those platforms.

## 2026-09-22 — connected components, EDT and sharing inventory

Added CPU/CUDA 8-connected equal-value components with 64-bit labels/counts,
root-index labeling and zero background. CUDA uses atomic union-find and never
merges across image boundaries. Added separable Euclidean distance transform
with float32 output and double-precision envelope intersections; singleton
spatial dimensions and empty batches are supported. Upstream's finite infinity
for all-foreground input is retained.

Validation completed locally:

- 4 CTest CPU/CUDA cases, plus a separate build with custom CUDA kernels disabled
  (2 CTest cases), all passed.
- Independent reference suite: 67 CPU + 67 CUDA scenarios passed, including
  noncontiguous images, multivalued components, diagonal connectivity, large
  cross-block regions and brute-force distance comparisons.
- Direct original-Triton comparison: 6 mask, 4 NMS, 4 component and 2 EDT cases
  passed. `upstream-ops-validation.json` records the environment.
- Compute Sanitizer memcheck and synccheck: zero errors on the standalone CUDA
  primitive test. These checks exercise the probe, not a full model workload.

Exact checkpoint inventory: 3,088 tensor references, 2,998 unique typed/shaped
contents, 6,951,840,400 logical bytes and 6,898,771,600 unique bytes. Exact
sharing saves 53,068,800 bytes; only 33,733,632 unique bytes occur in both model
versions. Thus SAM3 and SAM3.1 encoders must not be assumed to share parameters.
The larger distribution saving will come from reusing each version's modules
across image/video use, not duplicating full checkpoints per execution path.
`native/tools/inventory_weights.py` reproduces the analysis; the detailed
inventory is private and the size summary is `weight-sharing.json`.

All of these primitives are available to C++ callers and development tests;
the original SAM3 Python inference paths have not yet been rewired. The native
library is still not a full model runtime. Next: model reference fixtures,
on-demand shared weight storage, C++ model components and host session control.
